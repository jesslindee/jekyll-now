1. What did you do this past week? 

This past week I finished the Collatz assignment. In doing so I became more familiar with GitHub, TravisCI, coverage, unittest, and testing my own code more extensively than I have for past programs. I ran into a lot of issues along the way, and I made the mistake of not starting the project early, so it was a bit of a crunch to get everything working in time.

2. What's in your way?

A lack of time, it feels like. This semester I’m also taking CS 439, so I’ll have to balance the assignments in that class with the assignments in this class. I’ll just need to keep a tight schedule. Also I’m getting behind on the book readings, which is causing issues with some of the in class quizzes.

3. What will you do next week?

Next week I will work on the Netflix assignment early and catch up on readings for this class. While not directly related to this class, I will also work on my resume for the upcoming career fair in the hopes that I can get a software engineering internship where I can use the skills I’ve learned/will learn in this class.

Experience in the class:
    The code for the Collatz project wasn’t too difficult, but trying to use all of the tools we were supposed to use was time consuming. Travis CI gave me a fair amount of trouble, and I found it frustrating that Sphere didn’t give out all of the details for the problem (such as handling new lines). I also wasn’t entirely sure how to write failure cases, and I’m still not sure I understand what they are supposed to do. As an aside, being called on in class to work through the code is a little rough cause I’m usually only half awake when class meets. Guess I need to start bringing coffee!


Tip of the week: I didn’t really understand how branching worked in git for this project, but I think [this tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches) gives a good explanation so that I can use branches going forward.
