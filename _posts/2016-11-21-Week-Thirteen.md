1. What did you do this past week?  
	This past week we finished up the IDB project by adding a site-wide search bar to the splash page. I think ours looks really good! Kudos to Alan and Seth on our team for making it so nice. Check it out at [boilerpl8.me](http://boilerpl8.me/)!

2. What's in your way?  
	Not too much honestly. This upcoming week is a pretty chill one because it’s Thanksgiving break (yay!), so I won’t be doing much school work if I can help it. It’s surprising that the end of the semester is right around the corner. I suppose I should start studying for the final for this class during the break cause I know that the week right after Thanksgiving is going to be really hectic. 

3. What will you do next week?  
	Catch up on sleep, eat turkey, and take some of the burden off of the last week of class by starting to study over the break. 

My experience in class:  
It turns out that we’re going to lose 20% on this phase’s grade because we forgot to submit the log for the project. It seems like a little steep of a penalty, but it is what it is. The penalty was clearly defined and we goofed. 

In class we went over method overriding, which is something I’m pretty familiar with from CS314. It was interesting to learn that you can’t override private methods though. I’ll be honest and say I missed that quiz question cause I didn’t bother to check if the method was public or private. I won’t make that mistake again! We also went over more refactoring practices, which are useful to know.
