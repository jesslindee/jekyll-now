1. What did you do this past week?  
	This past week my group and I finished up the second part for the IDB project. I mainly worked on building the API and filling in where needed. I enjoyed this section of the project more than the last one because I was working on things I find more interesting (backend stuff) and also because we already had the base of the website set up - it's easier to add on features than to build something from scratch. Unfortunately, we still were met with a time crunch this project. We're going to try to be a bit better about starting things earlier so we don't have that stressful rush at the end. Overall I think the website is coming along nicely and I'm learning a lot from this project. 

2. What's in your way?  
	Once again it's a matter of not having time. I have a big project due this Friday that is going to eat up most of my time.

3. What will you do next week?  
	Next week I'll focus more on the IDB project and finalizing our website. We have some ideas of features that aren't required that we want to add to the webpage that I'm excited about implementing! 

My experience in class:  
	In class we learned about regular expressions and databases. I have no previous experience with regex's so it's interesting to learn about them! Same with databases. I missed class on Thursday, so I need to review the content that I missed. It looks like more detailed info about databases. 

Tip of the week:  


- [Here](https://regexcrossword.com/) is a regex crossword website. It has some concepts we haven't learned, but it's still cool to try out. (Credit for finding this website goes to Stas Ilinskiy and his [SWE blog](http://ilinskiy.me/swe-blog/Week-10/))

- [This](http://www.vertabelo.com/blog/notes-from-the-lab/9-tips-for-better-database-design) is an article with tips to build a better database. It might be a little late for it for this project, but it's good to know. 

- Lastly, [here](https://piazza.com/class/is7tzuwt2r8249?cid=194) is a  list of everyone's websites in the class in case you want to see them! :)
