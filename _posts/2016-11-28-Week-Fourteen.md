title: Week Fourteen

1. What did you do this past week?  
Last week I didn't do much for this class or any other class really. I’d hoped to start studying over the break, but I think taking an all out break from schoolwork did me well. It’s good to take a mental break every once in awhile.


2. What's in your way?  
A lack of desire to get back into the grind. The break halted most of the momentum I had for classes, so getting back into things takes some effort. I’ve gotten a little burnt out by this semester, so I’m not eager to return to the stress. On the plus side there are only two more weeks left in the semester for me, so at least I won’t have to deal with it for super long. It’s always rough coming back from Thanksgiving break cause you return to one of the busiest weeks. I definitely needed the break though - sleep is good. 


3. What will you do next week?  
This upcoming week I’ll study for the exam and do the course instructor survey! I’m glad that there isn’t a final for this course even though it means I have two tests on the same day this week. I’ve got to pace my studying so that I can properly prepare for both exams. 


My experience in class:  
We finished up the last lecture on Tuesday! It seems so early to me cause some of my other classes will be teaching new material through next Monday. It's good to start wrapping things up though. I feel like I’ve learned a lot during this class, especially with the IDB project. It’s been a good class :)


Tip of the week:  [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki) is a useful tool for running a virtual machine on your computer


Also, today is Cyber Monday - go buy things on sale!
